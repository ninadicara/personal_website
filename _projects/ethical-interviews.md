This workshop was run twice in February and April 2019. It focussed on connecting ideas from active listening and reflective social work practices with research interviews on emotionally challenging topics. The aim was to equip PhD students to undertake these difficult interviews, and be prepared with strategies for managing the emotional needs of both the participant and themselves. 

The workshop was accompanied by a workbook that could be taken away to use as needed.
